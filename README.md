Responsive CSS project using parallax svg's, column, and flex layouts

This site was created as a 3 page responsive project showcasing the use of parallax images and column and flex layouts. The parallax example uses layered svg's created in Illustrator to create a 3d effect as the user scrolls. The column layout page uses images as links for the user to jump to respective areas on the page, which could be ideal for long articles, and the flex layout was made using a Zen Garden template as per the requirements of the project.
